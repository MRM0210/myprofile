            <h4 class="title">Interest In IT:</h4>
            <p> 
                My interest in IT is programming, my passion for programming was 
                sparked over the last 5 years while collecting and analysing data, 
                and automatically trading on live global sporting markets using 
                visual basics and a small amount of python, just as a hobby, 
                nothing too serious. I have also put together a few basic web 
                sites for some friends with WordPress and also used a bit of HTML, 
                CSS, JS and PHP. I definitely don’t claim to be an expert in any 
                of those languages. 
            </p><br>
            <p> 
                I choose RMIT as I recently completed the Intro to Programming and 
                Programming 1 units, (which I initially choose randomly) I feel these 
                units gave me a good understanding of the concepts of Object Orientated 
                Programming and Java, I enjoyed the way the courses were structured 
                and thought that working towards completing the Bachelor of IT degree 
                would be a challenging but rewarding way forward.
            </p><br>
            
            <p class="small-title">Some of the things I expect to learn from this course are:</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Programming using java and other languages,</li>
                <li>How to work with databases,</li>
                <li>Ux and Ui Design,</li>
                <li>Security,</li>
                <li>Website development,</li>
                <li>Cloud computing,</li>
                <li>Networking,</li>
                <li>How to work effectively in teams,</li>
                <li>And obviously much more.</li>

                physical activity is involved. They learn best by doing,

            <h4 class="title">Project Idea:</h4>
            <br>
            <p class="small-title">Overview:</p>
            <p>The project idea that I have decided on is a smartphone and desktop 
                application that uses sound/voice recognition to records a small 
                sample of a bird call, the application will then reports back to 
                the user the species of the bird as well as a small description. 
                The description will include details on the name of the name, 
                life expectancy, what region/country the bird is native to and 
                the approximate population of the animal. This application will 
                be similar to Shazam but instead of music it will be designed for 
                bird sounds.
            </p>
            <br>   
            <p class="small-title">Motivation:</p>
            <p>My motivation for this project idea has come about after hearing 
                many bird calls over the years, while many are very distinguishable, 
                there is often new or unique calls that I have never been able to 
                identify. The idea of having an application on me to quickly identify 
                a bird from its call is quite appealing to me. There are many bird 
                watching clubs and societies throughout the world who I feel would 
                appreciate this application, as all species of birds have unique calls. 
                The challenge of putting my programming skills to the test and working 
                with voice/sound recognition technologies is also a driving force 
                behind this idea.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="small-title">Description:</p>
            <p>The application will start by asking the student to either register or 
                sign in. The registration process will ask the student for their country, 
                state, name, age, gender and school year. The data provided will then be 
                stored in a user data base. Once the student is logged in a menu will 
                appear with the following options:
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Take a quiz</li>
                <li>View learning materials</li>
                <li>View profile</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>The “Take a quiz” option will proceed to ask the student subject and topic 
                within the subject they would like for the quiz. After all the input is 
                taken the application will proceed with a 20 question quiz on the subject 
                topic and difficulty level of the school year selected on their profile, 
                all question will be relevant to the school curriculum of the state of 
                the student. All results for each subject will be stored in a database and 
                the student will be notified about any areas where improvement is needed as 
                well as areas where improvements have been made.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The “View learning materials” option will proceed to ask the student what 
                school year, subject and topic within the subject they would like learning 
                materials for. The application will display a list of learning material 
                documents stored within the system as well as links to external learning 
                material on the web.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The “view profile” option will display all the results for each quiz taken 
                and also the improvements made during the year. A ranking of all registered 
                users will also be displayed for each year and subject. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>Storage of all the quiz questions will be in a file within the system and 
                user database will be located in a MySQL database using phpMyAdmin.
