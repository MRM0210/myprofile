            </div>
            <p class="small-title">What is my interest in IT</p>
            <p> 
                My interest in IT is programming, my passion for programming was 
                sparked over the last 5 years while collecting and analysing data, 
                and automatically trading on live global sporting markets using 
                visual basics and a small amount of python, just as a hobby, 
                nothing too serious. I have also put together a few basic web 
                sites for some friends with WordPress and also used a bit of HTML, 
                CSS, JS and PHP. I definitely don’t claim to be an expert in any 
                of those languages. 
            </p>
            <p class="small-title">Why I chose to study with RMIT</p>
            <p> 
                I chose RMIT as I recently completed the Intro to Programming and 
                Programming 1 units, (which I initially chose randomly) I feel these 
                units gave me a good understanding of the concepts of Object Orientated 
                Programming and Java, I enjoyed the way the courses were structured 
                and thought that working towards completing the Bachelor of IT degree 
                would be a challenging but rewarding way forward.
            </p>
            <p class="small-title">Some of the things I expect to learn from this course</p>
            <ul>
                <li>Programming using java and other languages,</li>
                <li>How to work with databases,</li>
                <li>Ux and Ui Design,</li>
                <li>Security,</li>
                <li>Website development,</li>
                <li>Cloud computing,</li>
                <li>Networking,</li>
                <li>How to work effectively in teams,</li>

            </div>
            <p class="small-title">What the results of the test mean for me?</p>
            <p>The results of these tests are an indication of the personal traits that I have 
                in regards to personality, learning style and creativity. The results of the 
                personality test and the learning test show similar traits in that I’m a tactile 
                learner as I would rather make a judgement based on hands on experiencing or 
                observation.  The personality test has revealed that I am 67% Introverted which 
                can be both negative and positive depending on the situation. While I’m not 
                entire sure that I have a tendency to make decisions based on emotion over 
                thinking the test results shows that I can make emotional decisions, which can 
                cause irrational decision making. My creativity result is leaning towards the 
                complexity side of the diagram, meaning I have the ability to carry large amounts 
                of information with the also ability to manage relationships between such 
                information.
            </p>
            <p class="small-title">How will these results influence my behavior within a team?</p>
            <p>I think these results will influence my behaviour in a team environment in a positive 
                way. I like to get hands on and jump into tasks by doing a lot of work myself as to 
                not let anyone down. I will need to make decision in a rational and logical manner 
                while avoiding emotional decisions which can be a problem.  While the test says that 
                I am 67% introverted, I believe that working in a group environment and collaborating 
                to achieve a common goal is something that will not be problem for me. 
            </p>
            <p class="small-title">How should this be taken into account when forming a team?</p>
            <p>Teams need a mixture of different personality types with different skills sets. A team 
                of people that are all the same will not have the wide range of skills needed to 
                complete a variety of tasks. When forming a team you need personality types and 
                skill sets that will complement each other. You also need know the weaknesses within 
                the team and recruit people who have strengths to overcome the weaknesses of others. 
                The goal will be to create a team with diverse personalities and a large combined skill 
                set to give yourselves the best chance of producing the optimum results.

                <h4 class="title">Project Idea</h4>
            </div>
            <p class="small-title">Overview</p>
            <p>The project that I have decided on is a smartphone and desktop learning 
                web application for primary school aged students and parents. The 
                application content will be based on the curriculum of each school year, 
                and broken down into all the main subjects that students undertake 
                during each year. Each subject will have quizzes that will test the 
                child’s knowledge and report back on areas they need to improve on. 
                Each students progress will be ranked against all other students in 
                the system for each school year and subject. All information will be 
                accessible by registered parents. There will also be a discussion forum 
                for the parents to communicate with each other about the curriculum and 
                share teaching techniques.
            </p>  
            <p class="small-title">Motivation</p>
            <p>The challenge of getting my two primary school aged children to complete 
                their homework each night is the motivating factor behind this idea, to 
                say it’s a challenge is a major understatement!!! The idea of having a 
                fun and interactive application for my children to study relevant content 
                at the click of a button while receiving instant feedback on their work 
                is the driving force for this project. The Idea of a platform to communicate 
                with other parents about the curriculum and share teaching techniques is 
                also very appealing. I am also highly motivated by the challenge of 
                programming an application like this using and learning the different 
                languages and technologies required to complete this task.  
            </p>
            <p class="small-title">Description</p>
            <p>The application will start by asking the user to either register as a parent or student. 
                The registration process for a student will ask the student for their country, state, 
                name, age, gender and school year. The registration for a parent will ask for name, 
                how many primary school aged children they have and weather they would like to link 
                their account to a child’s account. The data provided will then be stored in a user 
                data base. 
                <br><br>
                Once the user is logged in as a student a menu will appear with the following options:          
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>Take a quiz</li>
                <li>View learning materials</li>
                <li>View profile</li>
            </ul>
            <p> The “Take a quiz” option will proceed to ask the student for a subject and a topic within 
                the subject they would like for the quiz. After all the input is taken the 
                application will proceed with a 20 question quiz on the subject topic and 
                difficulty level of the school year selected on their profile, all question 
                will be relevant to the school curriculum of the state of the student. 
                All results for each subject will be stored in a database and the student 
                will be notified about any areas where improvement is needed as well as 
                areas where improvements have been made.
            </p>
            <p> The “View learning materials” option will proceed to ask the student what school 
                year, subject and topic within the subject they would like learning materials for.
                The application will display a list of learning material documents stored within 
                the system as well as links to external learning material on the web.
            </p>
            <p> The “view profile” option will display all the results for each quiz taken and also 
                the improvements made during the year. A ranking of all registered users will also 
                be displayed for each year and subject. 
                <br><br>
                Once the user is logged in as a parent a menu will appear with two options:
                <br>     
            </p>
            <ul>
                <li>View linked student accounts,</li>
                <li>View Parent forum.</li>
            </ul>
            <p>The “View linked student accounts” option will display a list of student accounts that 
                you have linked to your account. You can select a student account and review progress
                 reports, results and rankings. If no student accounts are linked the application 
                 will display an appropriate message.
            <br><br>
                The “View parents forum” will display a list of discussions available for 
                each year and subject. This feature will give parents a chance to talk to other 
                parents about the curriculum of other schools and states.
                <br><br>
                The application will have a user interface that is simple for the user to understand 
                yet still be aesthetically pleasing while at the same time having all the relevant 
                features that are required.
                <br><br>
                A large data base of questions will be stored in the system and the questions will be 
                selected at random when quizes are taken. This will ensure that each quiz taken will 
                be different.      
            </p>
            <p class="small-title">Tools and Technologies</p>
            <p>Some of the tools and technologies required include languages such as HTML, CSS and 
                JavaScript for the front end development and user interface, while programming
                languages such as Java, PHP, Python or Ruby are all solid choices for the back end 
                development tasks such as input validation and login systems. There are also many 
                frameworks available to choose from such as Django for python, Laravel for PHP and 
                Ruby on Rails which simplifies the task of developing a web application, making the 
                task a lot faster and easier by doing a lot of the back end work for you. There are 
                also many choices for databases handling such as phpMyAdmin which is a free and 
                open source tool for MySQL.         
            </p>
            <p class="small-title">Skills required</p>
            <p>The main skills needed to complete this project are:</p>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    The ability to design and develop a user interface that is simple for the 
                    user to understand yet still be aesthetically pleasing while at the same 
                    time having all the relevant features that are required. 
                </li>
                <li>
                    The ability to write program logic in one of the above mentioned 
                    programming languages and/or frameworks to solve problems efficiently 
                    and to develop the application to a professional standard.
                </li>
                <li>
                    The ability to connect the application to a database to store all user data reliably 
                    and secure.
                </li>
            </ul>
            <p>
                    The skills required are all basic programming core skills that are very achievable to 
                    attain. There is hundreds of websites, forums and books online with up to date 
                    information on all the technologies needed for this project.
            </p>
            <p class="small-title">Outcome</p>
            <p>The intended outcome of this application is to give students another option for learning 
                the topics covered in school. The objective of the project is to create a fun and 
                interactive learning environment for students while hopefully having a positive impact 
                on the grades achieved by students. Keeping users informed on how well they are going 
                in relation to other students of the same age may result in the child working harder to
                 move up the rankings. Parents being able to communicate with other parents about 
                 anything related to the curriculum may result in resources and teaching techniques 
                 being shared around, which can only result in a positive outcome for both students 
                 and parents.
