            <h4 class="title">Interest In IT:</h4>
            <p> 
                My interest in IT is programming, my passion for programming was 
                sparked over the last 5 years while collecting and analysing data, 
                and automatically trading on live global sporting markets using 
                visual basics and a small amount of python, just as a hobby, 
                nothing too serious. I have also put together a few basic web 
                sites for some friends with WordPress and also used a bit of HTML, 
                CSS, JS and PHP. I definitely don’t claim to be an expert in any 
                of those languages. 
            </p><br>
            <p> 
                I choose RMIT as I recently completed the Intro to Programming and 
                Programming 1 units, (which I initially choose randomly) I feel these 
                units gave me a good understanding of the concepts of Object Orientated 
                Programming and Java, I enjoyed the way the courses were structured 
                and thought that working towards completing the Bachelor of IT degree 
                would be a challenging but rewarding way forward.
            </p><br>
            
            <p class="small-title">Some of the things I expect to learn from this course are:</p><br>

            <ul>
                <li>Programming using java and other languages,</li>
                <li>How to work with databases,</li>
                <li>Ux and Ui Design,</li>
                <li>Security,</li>
                <li>Website development,</li>
                <li>Cloud computing,</li>
                <li>Networking,</li>
                <li>How to work effectively in teams,</li>
                <li>And obviously much more.</li>

            <br>
            <p class="small-title">Overview:</p>
            <p>The project that I have decided on is a smartphone and desktop learning 
                web application for primary school aged students and parents. The 
                Application content will be based on the curriculum of each school year, 
                and broken down into all the main subjects that students undertake during 
                each year. Each subject will have quizzes that will test the child’s 
                knowledge and report back on areas they need to improve on. Each student 
                progress will be ranked against all other users in the system for each 
                school year and subject. All information will also be accessible by 
                registered parents. There will also be a discussion forum for the parents 
                to communicate with other parent with children in the same school year.
            </p>
            <br>   
            <p class="small-title">Motivation:</p>
            <p>The challenge of getting my two primary school aged children to complete 
                their homework each night is the motivating factor behind this idea, to 
                say it’s a challenge is a major understatement!!! The idea of having a 
                fun interactive application for my children to study relevant content 
                at the click of a button while receiving instant feedback on their work 
                is the driving force for this project. The Idea of a platform to 
                communicate with other parents about my child and other children’s 
                progress is also very appealing. I am also highly motivated by the 
                challenge of programming an application like this using and learning 
                the different languages and technologies required to complete this task. 
            </p>
            <br>
            <p class="small-title">Description:</p>
            <p>The application will start by asking the user to either register as a 
                parent or student. The registration process for a student will ask the 
                student for their country, state, name, age, gender and school year. 
                The registration for a parent will ask for name, how many primary school 
                aged children they have and weather they would like to link their account 
                to a child’s account. The data provided will then be stored in a user data.
                <br> <br>
                Once the user is logged in as a student a menu will appear with the following 
                options:       
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>Take a quiz</li>
                <li>View learning materials</li>
                <li>View profile</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>The “Take a quiz” option will proceed to ask the student subject and topic 
                within the subject they would like for the quiz. After all the input is 
                taken the application will proceed with a 20 question quiz on the subject
                 topic and difficulty level of the school year selected on their profile, 
                 all question will be relevant to the school curriculum of the state of 
                 the student. All results for each subject will be stored in a database 
                 and the student will be notified about any areas where improvement is 
                 needed as well as areas where improvements have been made.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The “View learning materials” option will proceed to ask the student what school 
                year, subject and topic within the subject they would like learning materials 
                for. The application will display a list of learning material documents stored 
                within the system as well as links to external learning material on the web.
            </p>
            <br>
            <p>The “view profile” option will display all the results for each quiz taken and 
                also the improvements made during the year. A ranking of all registered users 
                will also be displayed for each year and subject. 
                <br><br>
                Once the user is logged in as a parent a menu will appear with two options:     
            </p>
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>View linked student accounts,</li>
                <li>View Parent forum.</li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            <p>The “View Linked student accounts” option will display a list of student account 
                that you have linked to your account. You can select a student account and 
                review progress reports, results and rankings. If no student accounts are 
                linked the application will display an appropriate message.
            <br><br>
                The “View parents forum” will display a list of discussions available for 
                each year and subject.
            <br><br>
                Storage of all the quiz questions will be in a file within the system and 
                user database will be located in a MySQL database using phpMyAdmin.
